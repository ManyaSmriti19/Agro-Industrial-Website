Safety and sustainability are integral part and parcel of everyday's life and so is it
in the world of industry.Creating a safer and healthy environment for workers and people
around is essentially what the era demands.
<br>
<br>
Workers should be provided with protective hand gloves,helmets,eye masks and other
essentials.They should be trained for using equipment,machines and tools properly.
<br>
<br>
Another matter of grave concern for industries is <u>Proper Waste Disposal</u>.Waste
should be properly disposed. It should not be dumped on outskirts.Segregation(waste
separation using container units) and landfill(burying waste in the lands) are some of
the dumping strategies for waste management.But why just to manage??? why not turn it 
into useful resources.Compositing(waste into organic compounds to feed plants) and
recycling serves the purpose.
<br>
<br>
Over exploitation of resources is threat to world today.<u>Sustainable Development</u>
is the key to it.
Inputs should be sustainable and such that common people also get benefitted through
industrial projects.
Locally made products and services can be used which in turn creates local jobs.It also
leads to community identification and involovement.
